In this project, I prepared a complete Statement of Cash Flows using the direct method for Orion Corporation. Drawing on comparative balance sheets, income statement data, and a series of real-world transaction scenarios, I identified and adjusted for non-cash items, investing activities, and financing changes. This process strengthened my ability to analyze financial statements and apply accounting principles to accurately track and explain changes in a companyâ€™s cash position. The project reflects my skills in financial analysis, attention to detail, and understanding of GAAP-compliant reporting.
